# REBALL - Supabase SQL Setup Instructions

## ðŸ“‹ Execute These SQL Scripts in Order

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor**

---

## Step 1: Add Stripe Fields to Database

**File:** `stripe-schema-migration.sql`

Copy and paste the entire contents of this file into Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

This adds:
- âœ… `stripe_product_id` to courses table
- âœ… `stripe_price_id` to courses table
- âœ… `stripe_payment_intent_id` to bookings table
- âœ… `stripe_session_id` to bookings table
- âœ… Performance indexes

**Safe to run:** Uses `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` - won't break existing data

---

## Step 2: Seed All 14 Courses

**File:** `seed-courses.sql`

Copy and paste the entire contents of this file into Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

This creates/updates:
- âœ… 2 Striker courses (Essential Â£199 / Advanced Â£299)
- âœ… 4 Winger courses (2 Crossing + 2 Finishing)
- âœ… 4 CAM courses (2 Crossing + 2 Finishing)
- âœ… 2 Full-back courses
- âœ… 2 Centre-back courses

**Safe to run:** Uses `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` - won't create duplicates

---

## Step 3: Verify Everything Worked

Run this query in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check Stripe fields were added
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'courses' AND column_name LIKE '%stripe%';

-- Check courses were seeded
SELECT id, title, position, level, price, is_active
FROM courses
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY position, level;
```

You should see:
- âœ… 4 Stripe-related columns
- âœ… 14 active courses with prices

---

## Step 4: Push Code to Vercel

After running the SQL scripts:

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Stripe payment integration"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy with the new payment features.

---

## Step 5: Add Stripe Keys to Vercel

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard â†’ reball â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables**

Add these variables:

```
Name: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
Value: sk_test_... (your Stripe secret key)

Name: STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY  
Value: pk_test_... (your Stripe publishable key)

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
Value: pk_test_... (same as above)

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
Value: https://reball.uk

Name: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
Value: whsec_... (get this after Step 6)
```

**Redeploy** after adding environment variables.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Stripe Webhook

Go to: **Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks**

1. Click "Add endpoint"
2. Endpoint URL: `https://reball.uk/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select these events:
   - âœ… `checkout.session.completed`
   - âœ… `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - âœ… `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - âœ… `charge.refunded`
4. Click "Add endpoint"
5. **Copy the Signing Secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
6. Add it to Vercel environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
7. **Redeploy Vercel** after adding the webhook secret

---

## âœ… That's It!

Once you complete these 6 steps:
- âœ… Database has Stripe fields
- âœ… All 14 courses are in database with pricing
- âœ… Stripe is configured
- âœ… Webhook is listening
- âœ… Payments will work!

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Use Stripe test card: **4242 4242 4242 4242**
- Any future expiry date
- Any 3-digit CVC
- Any postal code

**When ready for production:**
- Switch to live Stripe keys (`sk_live_...` and `pk_live_...`)
- Update webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
- Test with a small real transaction

---

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps

After running these SQL scripts, let me know and I'll:
1. âœ… Add purchase buttons to all 14 course detail pages
2. âœ… Add pricing to course listing cards
3. âœ… Create "My Courses" dashboard section
4. âœ… Add payment success page
5. âœ… Test the complete flow
