# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT - Run This First!

## You're getting errors because we need to check your database structure first.

---

## **Step 1: Run This Script** 

**File:** `0-diagnose-database.sql`

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor**
2. Copy the **entire contents** of `0-diagnose-database.sql`
3. Paste and click **Run**
4. **Take a screenshot or copy the output**
5. **Send me the output** so I can see:
   - What tables exist
   - What columns are in the courses table
   - What the actual column names are

---

## **Why This is Needed:**

Your database was likely created by Prisma at some point, and the column names might be:
- All lowercase: `title`, `description`, `level`
- Or camelCase: `Title`, `Description`, `Level`  
- Or something else

Once I see the actual column names, I'll create the correct SQL scripts that match your exact database structure.

---

## **After You Send Me the Output:**

I'll create custom SQL scripts that:
- âœ… Work with your exact database structure
- âœ… Add only the Stripe columns needed
- âœ… Seed courses with the correct column names
- âœ… Won't cause any errors

---

## **Quick Alternative:**

If you prefer, just **copy-paste the output** from running `0-diagnose-database.sql` here, and I'll immediately fix everything! ðŸš€
